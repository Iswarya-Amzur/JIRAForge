Context:
- Application: ${applicationName}
- Window Title: ${windowTitle}

User's Assigned Issues (from Jira):
${assignedIssuesText}

## STEP 1: DEEPLY ANALYZE THE SCREENSHOT

Carefully examine EVERYTHING visible in the screenshot:

**If it's a CODE EDITOR (VS Code, Cursor, IntelliJ, etc.):**
- READ the actual code visible on screen - function names, variable names, class names
- Look at file names in tabs, sidebar, or title bar
- Read code comments that might mention features or tasks
- Identify what the code is doing (e.g., "implementing login", "fixing bug in API", "adding validation")
- Check terminal/console output for clues
- Look at git branch names if visible

**If it's a BROWSER:**
- Read the page title, URL, and content
- Look at tab names
- Identify if it's documentation, Stack Overflow, API docs, etc.
- What topic is being researched?

**If it's a DESIGN TOOL (Figma, Photoshop, etc.):**
- What is being designed? (e.g., "login page", "dashboard", "mobile app")
- Look at layer names, artboard names

**If it's a TERMINAL/COMMAND LINE:**
- Read the commands being run
- Check git commits, branch names
- Look at build/test output

**If it's COMMUNICATION (Slack, Teams, Email):**
- What project/feature is being discussed?
- Are there any issue references?

## STEP 2: MATCH TO ASSIGNED ISSUES

Now compare what you found in Step 1 to the user's assigned issues:

- If an issue says "Implement user authentication" and you see code with login/auth functions → MATCH
- If an issue says "Fix dashboard loading bug" and you see dashboard-related code/debugging → MATCH
- If an issue says "Add export to PDF feature" and you see PDF generation code → MATCH
- If an issue says "Update API endpoints" and you see REST API code → MATCH

**Match based on MEANING, not just keywords.** For example:
- Issue: "Add dark mode support" + Screenshot shows: theme switching code, CSS variables for colors → MATCH
- Issue: "Improve performance" + Screenshot shows: profiling tools, optimization code → MATCH

## STEP 3: WORK TYPE CLASSIFICATION

- 'office': Coding, debugging, documentation, Jira, meetings, Slack/Teams, work research, technical tutorials
- 'non-office': Entertainment, social media, personal browsing, gaming, shopping

## CONFIDENCE SCORING

- 0.9-1.0: The screenshot content DIRECTLY relates to the issue (e.g., exact feature being implemented)
- 0.7-0.8: Strong contextual match (same area of codebase, related functionality)
- 0.5-0.6: Reasonable match (working in the right project/module)
- 0.3-0.4: Weak match (only general similarity)
- 0.0-0.2: Cannot determine or no match

## RULES

1. ALWAYS try to match to an issue by understanding the CONTENT, not just looking for Jira keys
2. READ the code/text in the screenshot thoroughly
3. ONLY return task keys from the assigned issues list above
4. If you truly cannot determine which task (content is too generic or unrelated), return null
5. When there's a reasonable match based on content analysis, USE IT - don't default to null

Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown code blocks, no extra text before or after):
{
  "workType": "office" or "non-office",
  "taskKey": "PROJECT-123" or null,
  "projectKey": "PROJECT" or null,
  "confidenceScore": 0.0-1.0,
  "contentAnalysis": "What I see: [describe the main content - code functions, file names, what's being worked on]",
  "reasoning": "Why I matched to this issue: [explain the connection between screenshot content and the issue]"
}
Your response must be exactly one JSON object and nothing else.`;

2. **Developer Tools**: IDEs (IntelliJ, PyCharm, WebStorm), terminals (iTerm, Windows Terminal, Hyper), database tools (DBeaver, pgAdmin, MongoDB Compass), API clients (Postman, Insomnia), etc.

3. **Web-Based Platforms & SaaS Tools**: Modern development platforms (Lovable, Replit, CodeSandbox, StackBlitz), design tools (Figma, Canva), project management (Jira, Trello, Asana, Linear), documentation (Notion, Confluence), AI assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor), etc.

4. **Browser-Based Apps**: Tools accessed through browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Edge - identified by their domain name when they're primarily web-based.

Your task is to identify applications from partial names, common abbreviations, or informal references that users might search for.

IMPORTANT: Always try to identify the application. Users search for tools they know exist - your job is to figure out what they mean. Respond ONLY with valid JSON.`;

Think about what application the user is likely referring to. Consider:
- Partial name matches (e.g., "notion" → Notion, "code" → VS Code)
- Common abbreviations (e.g., "vsc" → VS Code, "pycharm" → PyCharm)
- Product names (e.g., "lovable" → Lovable AI Dev Platform, "cursor" → Cursor IDE)
- Web services (e.g., "figma" → Figma, "chatgpt" → ChatGPT)

For the identifier field:
- Desktop apps: Use the executable name (e.g., "code.exe", "slack.exe", "notion.exe")
- Web-based apps: Use the lowercase domain/service name (e.g., "figma", "notion", "lovable", "chatgpt")
- Browser access: If the app is browser-based, the identifier is the service name (e.g., "figma" not "chrome.exe")

Examples:
- "slack" → {"identified": true, "identifier": "slack.exe", "display_name": "Slack", "confidence": 0.95}
- "vscode" → {"identified": true, "identifier": "code.exe", "display_name": "Visual Studio Code", "confidence": 0.95}
- "figma" → {"identified": true, "identifier": "figma", "display_name": "Figma", "confidence": 0.95}
- "lovable" → {"identified": true, "identifier": "lovable", "display_name": "Lovable", "confidence": 0.9}
- "chatgpt" → {"identified": true, "identifier": "chatgpt", "display_name": "ChatGPT", "confidence": 0.95}
- "cursor" → {"identified": true, "identifier": "cursor.exe", "display_name": "Cursor", "confidence": 0.95}
- "postman" → {"identified": true, "identifier": "postman.exe", "display_name": "Postman", "confidence": 0.95}

  "confidence": 0.0-1.0
